Here are outlined some of the future directions for the debbugs
codebase and things that should be done.

PACKAGE CLEANUP

* Stop doing the .in -> foo translation
* Use ExtUtils::Makemaker instead of a custom makefile
* More testing of modules so it's not so easy to break things


GENERAL ORGANIZATIONAL CLEANUP

* Modularization
  * use of strict and warnings everywhere
  * Split out errorlib and common.pl; stop requiring stuff
  * Use CGI::Simple, URI, and Params::Validate instead of our own
    versions

* Configuration Module
  * Allow for multiple debbugs configurations; easy overriding of values
  * Possibly implemented using Config::General (maybe Config::Simple?)
    with hack to allow for backwards compatibility
    - The backwards compatibility hack is now fully implemented, a
      decision on a configuration system just needs to be made.

* Separation of Output forms from the code
  * Use Text::Template to do this; it's simple, we don't lose
    flexibility if we need it

* Bring back all of the helper scripts into the bzr repository and
  document the setup of Debian's bts

FEATURES

* Full text searching -- using Hyper Estraier (in progress on merkel)
  * See Debbugs::Estraier

* CGI Options enable/disable forms

* Better display of bugs in bug lists
  - Display subsidiary bugs: merged bugs, block bugs, etc.

* Archiving [display of applicable bugs even if they are archived]
